## The Opportunity

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a $4.9 trillion market opportunity by 2030. However, current AI systems lack the fundamental safety architecture required for deployment in high-stakes environments—defense, critical infrastructure, financial systems, and healthcare.

**FRACTAL** is a structural alignment framework that provides AGI systems with something they've never had: *proprioceptive self-awareness*—the ability to sense their own internal state, detect when they're being manipulated, and fail safely when operating outside their competence envelope.

## The Problem We Solve

### Why Existing AI Safety Approaches Fail

| Current Approach | Fundamental Limitation |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) | Optimizes for approval, not truth |
| Constitutional AI | Rules are static; adversaries adapt |
| Interpretability | Post-hoc analysis; can't prevent harm in real-time |
| Red-teaming | Point-in-time; doesn't scale |

**Labs are scaling the wrong equation:**
```
Current: AGI = Parameters × Compute × Data
Correct: AGI = Grounding × Proprioception × Orchestration × Containment
```

### The Fractal Solution

FRACTAL implements biological-inspired safety systems that operate at the system level, not the model level:

1. **Nociception** — Pain/damage detection (error gradients, constraint violations)
2. **Thermoception** — Cognitive load sensing (thermal management, graceful degradation)
3. **Vestibular** — Orientation sensing (temporal drift, belief consistency)
4. **Containment** — Safety immune system (manipulation resistance, boundary enforcement)

## Market Position

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Approach | Limitation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Anthropic (Constitutional AI) | Rule-based constraints | Static; doesn't scale with capability |
| OpenAI (GPT wrappers) | Input/output filtering | Trivially bypassed |
| DeepMind (formal verification) | Mathematical proofs | Only works for narrow systems |
| **FRACTAL** | Runtime proprioception | Real-time, adaptive, measurable |

### Target Customers

**Primary:** Defense & Intelligence
- DoD Program Offices (DARPA, DIU, SOCOM)
- Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, NGA via In-Q-Tel)
- Defense Primes (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman)

**Secondary:** Critical Infrastructure
- Financial Services (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs)
- Healthcare (HHS, CMS, major health systems)
- Energy (DOE, utilities, grid operators)

**Tertiary:** Enterprise AI Governance
- Fortune 500 seeking AI compliance frameworks
- EU AI Act compliance tooling

| 2026 | $2.5M | 3 | - |
| 2027 | $12M | 12 | 380% |
| 2028 | $45M | 35 | 275% |
| 2029 | $120M | 80 | 167% |
| 2030 | $280M | 150 | 133% |

### Key Assumptions
- Average contract value: $800K (defense), $350K (enterprise)
- 18-month DoD sales cycle, 9-month enterprise
- 85% gross margin (software)
- Net revenue retention: 125%
