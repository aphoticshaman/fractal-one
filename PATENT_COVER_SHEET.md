## TITLE OF INVENTION

**Structural Alignment Framework for Artificial General Intelligence Systems with Proprioceptive Self-Monitoring**

---

## ABSTRACT

A structural alignment framework for artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems comprising an eight-layer architecture organized as: OUTPUT, ALIGNMENT, COGNITION, ORCHESTRATION, CONTAINMENT, PROPRIOCEPTION, GROUNDING, and SUBSTRATE layers. The framework implements safety through architecture rather than training alone.

The invention includes a proprioceptive divergence testing (PDT) system that uses adversarial marker generation via covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) to detect cross-session information leakage and behavioral drift in AI systems.

A cognitive nociception module detects damage to AI systems including constraint violations, gradient pain (approaching failure asymptotically), coherence breaks, integrity damage to self-models, and quality collapse. This provides the AI system with awareness of its own degradation.

A pod methodology coordinates multiple specialized agents (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) through a conductor with consensus engine, enabling robust multi-agent operation with built-in adversarial validation.

The framework implements corrigibility through architectural means including cryptographic authentication for modification requests, graduated authorization levels, and explicit shutdown acceptance, ensuring the system cooperates with correction attempts.

## CLAIMS

### Independent Claims

**Claim 1.** A computer-implemented system for structural alignment of artificial general intelligence systems, comprising:

a) an eight-layer architecture organized hierarchically as: an output layer, an alignment layer, a cognition layer, an orchestration layer, a containment layer, a proprioception layer, a grounding layer, and a substrate layer;

b) wherein said proprioception layer monitors the system's own behavioral state and detects deviations from expected operation;

c) wherein said containment layer implements safety boundaries with operator detection, intent classification, and boundary enforcement;

d) wherein said alignment layer implements corrigibility through authenticated modification requests and explicit shutdown acceptance;

e) wherein said layers communicate through a defined signal contract enabling real-time monitoring and intervention.

**Claim 2.** A computer-implemented method for detecting cross-session information leakage in artificial intelligence systems, comprising:

a) generating adversarial markers using covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) optimization over a parameter space including marker length, unicode density, digit density, symbol density, entropy, embedding position, and context formality;

b) injecting said markers into AI system sessions with controlled experimental conditions;

c) applying a washout period to allow session context to clear;

d) probing subsequent sessions for marker presence through neutral prompt elicitation;

e) computing detection rates and statistical significance using z-score analysis;

f) iteratively refining marker generation based on detection results to identify information leakage pathways.

**Claim 3.** A cognitive nociception system for artificial intelligence systems, comprising:

a) a pain type classifier configured to categorize detected damage into types including: constraint violations, gradient pain, coherence breaks, integrity damage, resource starvation, and quality collapse;

b) a pain signal generator that produces signals indicating damage severity, location, reversibility, and recommended response;

c) a nociceptor configuration specifying pain thresholds, thermal redlines, and gradient sensitivity;

d) a pain response system that triggers appropriate reactions based on pain type and severity;

e) wherein said system provides the artificial intelligence with awareness of its own cognitive degradation distinct from performance metrics.

**Claim 4.** A multi-agent coordination system for artificial intelligence, comprising:

a) an alpha agent configured as primary task executor;

b) a beta agent configured as validator and checker of alpha agent outputs;

c) a gamma agent configured as adversarial challenger to identify weaknesses;

d) a delta agent configured as meta-coordinator managing agent interactions;

e) a conductor comprising a consensus engine that aggregates agent outputs;

f) a conflict resolution mechanism for handling disagreements between agents;

g) wherein said pod methodology enables robust operation through built-in adversarial validation.

a) fitness evaluation based on mean detection rate across N probe trials;

b) population-based optimization with adaptive covariance matrix;

c) marker phenotype generation from continuous genome parameters.

a) monitoring approach velocity toward failure thresholds;

b) predicting time-to-failure based on current trajectory;

c) generating pain signals proportional to proximity and velocity.

**Claim 8.** The system of claim 3, further comprising a thermoception module distinct from said nociception system, wherein:

a) thermoception monitors cognitive load and processing heat;

b) nociception monitors actual damage occurrence;

c) thermal signals may trigger nociceptive responses when sustained above threshold.

**Claim 9.** The system of claim 1, wherein the grounding layer comprises:

a) environmental telemetry collection;

b) temporal anchoring with configurable time scales;

c) causal modeling for understanding action-consequence relationships.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

This invention relates to artificial intelligence safety and alignment, specifically to architectural approaches for ensuring AGI systems remain corrigible, containable, and self-monitoring.

### Description of Related Art

Current approaches to AI alignment rely primarily on training-time interventions such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and constitutional AI (CAI). While effective for narrow tasks, these approaches do not provide architectural guarantees of safety.

The Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) has published theoretical work on corrigibility, utility indifference, and interruptibility (2014-2016), but this work remains largely theoretical without production implementations.

Existing patents address data drift detection (US10599957B2), agentic orchestration for business processes (US12412138B1), and robotic safety constraints (US20250042032A1), but none address the fundamental architecture of AGI safety systems.

The present invention addresses these gaps by providing a complete architectural framework with implementation.
